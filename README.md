A hyperlink:zap: always open a website in new window or in new window. But sometimes, its not needed!:thumbsdown: While attending virtual meets, attendees face a common problem, i.e whenever a link is prompted, their current window is abandoned and workflow shifts to new window. This can not be accepted as he/she might be having his camera on:trollface: OR some other task might me going on:eyes:.
